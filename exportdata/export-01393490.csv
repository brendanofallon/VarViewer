Variant list for sample Sample : 16287113005
Variant filters in use: 
Excluding variants with population frequency (from 1000 Genomes) > 0.1, ESP Freq > 5 ESP Homs > 1, and ARUP frequency greater than 0.2
Variants of the following types were excluded: intergenic, intergenic, intronic, non-coding RNA, synonymous SNPs (all regions), UTR
Variants with quality less than 20, read depth (coverage) less than 4, or allele balance less than 0.1 were excluded.
No filtering by predicted deleteriousness was performed.
No filtering based on gene name was performed.
No ClinVar, OMIM, or HGMD disease filtering was performed
